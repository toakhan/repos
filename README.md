# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor


 
**Before starting work on this assignment, reviewed the [Challenge Guide](./Challenge-Guide.md) and the [Good README Guide](./Good-README-Guide.md), 

This assignment involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 
 
I understand that one of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (To refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. As per the marketing agency requirements, I have refactored their existing site to include HTML & CSS semantic elements.
 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
 
 **Scout Rule** has been followed and left the code a little cleaner than when I started working on it.

To impress clients, I have gone the extra mile and improved the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, made sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Have fulfilled the Client's following requirements:

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Resources:

* [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
* [Image `alt` attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

### Getting Started

Followed these instructions and created my project and deployed it to GitHub Pages:

1. Created a new repository on my GitHub account and cloned it to my computer.

2. Used the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push the code to my GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to my GitHub repository in the browser and then selected the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, selected the `main` branch as source.

5. Navigated to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and found that my new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!
